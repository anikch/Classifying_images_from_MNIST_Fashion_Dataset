# Classifying_images_from_MNIST_Fashion_Dataset

- Prepared the dataset for the model
- Developed a Single Layer Perceptron model for classifying the handwritten digits and plotted the change in accuracyper epochs.
- Evaluated the model on the testing data and analyze the model summary
- Added a hidden layer to the model to make it Multilayer Perceptron
- Added Dropout to prevent overfitting and checked its effect on accuracy
- Increased the number of hidden layer neuron and checked its accuracy
- Used different optimizers and checked its effect on accuracy
- Increased the hidden layers and checked its effect on accuracy
- Manipulated the batch_size and epochs and checked its effect on accuracy
- Identified the best model
