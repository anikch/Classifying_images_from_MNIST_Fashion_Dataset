# Classifying_images_from_MNIST_Fashion_Dataset

**Problem Statement**
The dataset is similar to MNIST but includes images of certain  clothing  and  accessory.  The  objective  is  to classify images into specific classes using a single-layer perceptron & multilayer perceptron. Dataset DescriptionMNIST Fashion Dataset
- Total Images: 70,000
- Train Images: 60,000
- Test Images: 10,000
- Image Size:28 x 28
- Classes:‘T-Shirt/top’, ‘Trouser’, ‘Pullover’, ‘Dress’, ‘Coat’, ‘Sandal’, ‘Shirt’, ‘Sneaker’, ‘Bag’, ‘Ankle Boot’

**Approach**
- Prepared the dataset for the model
- Developed a Single Layer Perceptron model for classifying the handwritten digits and plotted the change in accuracyper epochs.
- Evaluated the model on the testing data and analyze the model summary
- Added a hidden layer to the model to make it Multilayer Perceptron
- Added Dropout to prevent overfitting and checked its effect on accuracy
- Increased the number of hidden layer neuron and checked its accuracy
- Used different optimizers and checked its effect on accuracy
- Increased the hidden layers and checked its effect on accuracy
- Manipulated the batch_size and epochs and checked its effect on accuracy
- Identified the best model
